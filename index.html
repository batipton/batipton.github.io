		<h1>Bryson's Personal Blog</h1>
		<p>
			This is my personal blog. 
			I'm using this as a personal project to improve on my technical writing and communication skills, but
			also to improve my HTML, CSS, and presentation skills.

			<strong>6-13-2024</strong> Looking for a software engineering job is hard right now. 
			Computer Science graduates are up while job positions are down. This presents me with
			interesting problems such as how to address a massive amount of failure and what to do with
			my free time. I've been working on a HTML, CSS, and JS card game and trying to brush up on my
			complex analysis because math is addicting to me. I read the Pragmatic Programmer and one of the
			things it suggest is to keep up with new technologies - which HTML, CSS, and JS are none of. I think
			in the coming days I will start practicing with a framework such as Next.js to get experience with 
			React.
